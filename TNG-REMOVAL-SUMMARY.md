## Files Updated

Key files updated include:

- PHP Controllers (e.g., citation-controller.php, dna-controller.php)
- JavaScript files (e.g., citation-modal.js, id-checker.js)
- CSS files (e.g., citation-modal.css)
- View Templates (e.g., families/browse-families.php)

## Verification

A final search confirmed that no TNG references remain in the codebase, except for:

- Files in the tng directory (intentionally preserved)
- Files specifically designated for TNG removal documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test the plugin functionality to ensure that all features continue to work as expected
2. Update any database references or constants that might still contain TNG naming
3. Update any documentation that hasn't been covered by the automated updates

## Completion Time

TNG removal process completed on June 20, 2025.
