# admin_changetree.php Conversion Notes

## Overview

Converted TNG `admin_changetree.php` to HeritagePress entity transfer system. This provides functionality for moving genealogy entities (people, sources, repositories) between trees.

## TNG Functionality Analyzed

The original file supported:

- Moving people between trees with optional ID changes
- Moving sources between trees with optional ID changes
- Moving repositories between trees with optional ID changes
- Two operation modes: Move (delete from source) or Copy (keep in source)
- Transfer of all associated data (events, notes, media, addresses, citations)

## HeritagePress Implementation

### Core Files Created

1. **`admin/controllers/class-hp-entity-transfer-controller.php`**

   - Main backend logic for entity transfers
   - Handles database operations, validation, security
   - AJAX endpoints for transfer operations
   - Support for people, sources, repositories

2. **`admin/views/entity-transfer-modal.php`**

   - Modern modal interface for transfers
   - Form validation and user feedback
   - Real-time ID availability checking
   - Tree selection and operation mode selection

3. **`admin/helpers/entity-transfer-integration.php`**
   - Helper functions to integrate transfer functionality
   - Adds "Change Tree" buttons to edit forms
   - Provides transfer links for list tables

### Key Features Implemented

#### Entity Support

- **People**: Full transfer with family relationship handling
- **Sources**: Transfer with citation cleanup
- **Repositories**: Transfer with address copying and source link cleanup

#### Transfer Operations

- **Move (Operation 0)**: Updates existing record, transfers to new tree
- **Copy (Operation 1)**: Creates duplicate in destination tree
- Optional ID changes during transfer
- Real-time validation of new IDs

#### Associated Data Migration

- Events and their addresses
- Notes and note links
- Media links
- Citations (cleanup for sources)
- Branch links (cleanup during person moves)
- Family relationships (cleanup during person moves)

#### Security & Validation

- WordPress nonce verification
- Capability checking (`edit_genealogy`)
- Input sanitization
- Transaction support for database operations
- Error handling and rollback

### Database Operations

#### Person Transfer

```sql
-- Update person record
UPDATE wp_hp_people SET gedcom='new_tree', personID='new_id' WHERE...

-- Update associated data
UPDATE wp_hp_events SET gedcom='new_tree', persfamID='new_id' WHERE...
UPDATE wp_hp_medialinks SET gedcom='new_tree', personID='new_id' WHERE...
UPDATE wp_hp_notelinks SET gedcom='new_tree', persfamID='new_id' WHERE...

-- Cleanup family relationships
UPDATE wp_hp_families SET husband='' WHERE gedcom='old_tree' AND husband='old_id'
UPDATE wp_hp_families SET wife='' WHERE gedcom='old_tree' AND wife='old_id'

-- Delete orphaned links
DELETE FROM wp_hp_branchlinks WHERE gedcom='old_tree' AND persfamID='old_id'
DELETE FROM wp_hp_citations WHERE gedcom='old_tree' AND persfamID='old_id'
DELETE FROM wp_hp_children WHERE gedcom='old_tree' AND personID='old_id'
```

#### Source Transfer

```sql
-- Update source record
UPDATE wp_hp_sources SET gedcom='new_tree', sourceID='new_id' WHERE...

-- Cleanup citations
DELETE FROM wp_hp_citations WHERE gedcom='old_tree' AND sourceID='old_id'
```

#### Repository Transfer

```sql
-- Update repository record
UPDATE wp_hp_repositories SET gedcom='new_tree', repoID='new_id' WHERE...

-- Copy address if exists
INSERT INTO wp_hp_addresses (address1, address2, city, state, zip, country, gedcom...)

-- Clear source links
UPDATE wp_hp_sources SET repoID='' WHERE gedcom='old_tree' AND repoID='old_id'
```

### WordPress Integration

#### Admin Menu Integration

- Automatic loading in admin area
- Modal integration on entity edit pages
- AJAX endpoints registered

#### User Interface

- Modern modal design
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Progress indicators
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Hooks and Filters

- `admin_footer` hook for modal loading
- AJAX action hooks for all operations
- Integration helper functions for forms

### Usage Instructions

#### For Developers

```php
// Add change tree button to edit forms
heritagepress_add_change_tree_button('person', $person_id, $tree_id);

// Add transfer link to list tables
echo heritagepress_get_transfer_link('source', $source_id, $tree_id);

// Trigger modal programmatically
$(document).trigger('heritagepress:open-transfer-modal', {
    entityType: 'person',
    entityId: 'I123',
    treeId: 'tree1'
});
```

#### For Users

1. Navigate to any entity edit page (person, source, repository)
2. Scroll to "Tree Management" section
3. Click "Move to Different Tree" button
4. Select destination tree and optional new ID
5. Choose Move or Copy operation
6. Click "Transfer Entity"

### Improvements Over TNG

#### Modern Architecture

- Object-oriented controller pattern
- Separation of concerns (logic/UI/integration)
- WordPress coding standards

#### Enhanced Security

- WordPress nonces and capability checking
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- Input validation and sanitization

#### Better User Experience

- Modal interface instead of separate page
- Real-time ID validation
- Progress feedback and error handling
- Responsive design

#### Database Integrity

- Transaction support for rollback on errors
- Better error handling and logging
- Cleaner relationship management

### Known Limitations

1. **Copy Operation**: Basic implementation - associated data copying needs enhancement
2. **Family Relationships**: Requires manual re-establishment after person moves
3. **Bulk Operations**: Single entity transfers only (could add bulk support)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Copy Mode**: Full duplication of events, notes, media
2. **Bulk Transfer**: Multiple entity transfers in single operation
3. **Relationship Preservation**: Smart family relationship handling
4. **Transfer History**: Audit trail of entity movements
5. **Validation Rules**: Configurable transfer restrictions
