# Album Management Conversion Notes

## Summary of Changes

The TNG album management functionality has been completely ported to HeritagePress as a native WordPress admin interface. This includes:

1. Album list view with search, pagination, and sorting capabilities
2. Add/Edit/Delete functionality for albums
3. Linking media to albums
4. Linking entities (people, families, sources, repositories) to albums
5. Public album display

## Implementation Notes

### Database Structure

The following tables were created to support this functionality:

- `wp_hp_albums`: Stores album metadata (name, description, keywords, active status, etc.)
- `wp_hp_albumlinks`: Links media items to albums
- `wp_hp_album2entities`: Links albums to various entities (people, families, sources, repositories)

### File Structure

- Controller: `admin/controllers/class-hp-album-controller.php`
- Views:
  - Main list view: `admin/views/albums-main.php`
  - Add form: `admin/views/albums-add.php`
  - Edit form: `admin/views/albums-edit.php`
  - Media management: `admin/views/albums-manage.php`

### Key Modifications

#### Modernization

1. **WordPress Integration**: All functionality is integrated with WordPress admin UI
2. **Security**: Added nonces, input sanitization, and capability checks
3. **OOP Approach**: Used object-oriented programming instead of procedural approach
